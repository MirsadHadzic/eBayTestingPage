# eBay Page Testing

SOFTWARE VERIFICATION, VALIDATION AND TESTING
 
 eBay is an online marketplace where individuals and businesses can buy and sell a wide variety of goods and services worldwide. The site allows users to post items for sale, and buyers can browse the listings and purchase items they're interested in. The site provides a wide range of features and tools to make buying and selling as easy as possible, including search and filtering options, detailed product information, and secure payment options. As part of the test project, we utilized Selenium to automate tasks such as navigating the site, inputting data into forms, and interacting with different page elements in order to ensure that the site is functioning correctly and that the user experience is optimal.
