# eBay Page Testing
 
 **eBay** is an online marketplace where individuals and businesses can buy and sell a wide variety of goods and services worldwide. 
 The site allows users to post items for sale, and buyers can browse the listings and purchase items they're interested in. 
 The site provides a wide range of features and tools to make buying and selling as easy as possible, including search and filtering options, detailed product      
 information, and secure payment options. As part of the test project, we utilized Selenium to automate tasks such as navigating the site, 
 inputting data into forms, and interacting with different page elements in order to ensure that the site is functioning correctly 
 and that the user experience is optimal.


We have created a .pdf document which details the actions and processes undertaken during the project (README_SVVT.pdf).
Additionally, we have implemented an additional test utilizing advanced Selenium features in a separate repository called eBayAdvancedTesting. 
This repository comprises of 15 tests, which have been thoroughly examined and evaluated.
